# Jest Testing
This is just comprised of some simple VanillaJS testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/).

Super simple and dumb examples, nothing major.

## The tests cover:

- Basic function tests
- ES6 Class tests
    - Uses `jest.mock()` to simulate an instance of the User class itself.
- Async test
    - Testing against a simple [JSON API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- DOM Manipulation testing

## Disclamer
I don't own the otter logo at all, jsut using it as an example, please don't sue me.
